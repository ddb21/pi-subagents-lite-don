/**
 * pi-boundaries.ts — Test-only boundaries with the pi SDK type surface.
 *
 * 1. Fake assertion — test fakes are partial objects, but pi's classes
 *    (AgentSession) and pi's context interfaces (ExtensionCommandContext)
 *    carry private members and hundreds of required fields, so no structural
 *    fake can satisfy them. The `as*` helpers assert the real type at the
 *    single call boundary where a src function requires it, and intersect the
 *    result with the fake's own type so vi.fn() members stay callable at the
 *    call site. Each helper holds exactly one cast.
 *
 * 2. Private member view — pi-tui's SelectList keeps `items` and
 *    `selectedIndex` private. `selectListView` exposes exactly those two
 *    members so menu tests can assert selection state without reaching into
 *    the class.

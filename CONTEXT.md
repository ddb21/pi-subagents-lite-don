# pi-subagents-lite

A lightweight pi extension that lets the LLM spawn autonomous child agents for complex tasks. Focused fork of pi-subagents with reduced surface area — no scheduling, no join modes.

## Language

### Core concepts

**Subagent**:
An autonomous child agent spawned from the parent conversation via the Agent tool.
_Avoid_: Child agent, worker, task agent

**Agent type**:
A named configuration (general-purpose, Explore, or custom) defining a subagent's tool set, skills, system prompt, and default model.
_Avoid_: Agent kind, agent class

**Agent briefing**:
A user message sent via `/agents` that teaches the LLM about available agent types and how to use the Agent tool. The LLM learns from conversation context, not from the tool schema.
_Avoid_: Agent documentation, tool description

**Stealth tool**:
A tool registered with no description, promptSnippet, or promptGuidelines. Usage is taught exclusively through the agent briefing.
_Avoid_: Hidden tool, minimal tool

### Configuration

**Global config**:
The personal baseline config file `~/.pi/agent/subagents-lite.json`, holding the full config surface and the default write target for menu changes.
_Avoid_: User config, personal config

**Project config**:
The per-project override file `.pi/subagents-lite.json` in a trusted project. Holds only model and concurrency overrides: each key it sets wins over the Global config, and an absent key inherits from it. An empty file (`{}`) is inert.
_Avoid_: Project settings, local config

**Model override**:
A user-configured model preference (per-type or global) set at session, global, or project level. A session per-type **Model override** beats every other source; a session default beats config per-type overrides and frontmatter models; the config default key applies only to types with no session default, no per-type override, and no frontmatter model. Set via `/agents` > Model settings.
_Avoid_: Model injection, model preference

**Grace turns**:
Additional turns allowed after the soft turn limit steer message before hard abort. Default 6, configurable via `/agents` > Model settings.
_Avoid_: Grace period, extra turns

**Resolved model**:
The model an Agent type runs on: session per-type > session default > config per-type (project over global) > config default (project over global) > the frontmatter model > the parent session's current model.
_Avoid_: Effective model, assigned model

**Thinking level**:
Per-spawn reasoning effort (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). Resolved as frontmatter `thinking` > `defaultThinking` (project over global) > the pi session default (pi's `defaultThinkingLevel` setting, else `medium`), then clamped to the **Resolved model**'s supported levels (non-reasoning models support only `off`).
_Avoid_: Reasoning effort, thinking mode

### Worktrees

**Worktree**:
A linked git worktree of the same repository as the parent, distinguished by its `--git-dir` pointing outside the worktree root. One possible target of the `worktree_path` Agent tool param (any git repo on disk is accepted).
_Avoid_: Git worktree, sibling worktree

**Worktree path**:
The resolved absolute filesystem path passed to the `worktree_path` param. Must be inside a git repository (any repo on disk, not only the parent's). Used as the subagent's working directory for its session, resource loader, and system prompt.
**Worktree label**:
A short human-readable identifier derived from the worktree path. `basename(root)` when targeting the root, else `basename(root)/<relative subpath>`.
_Avoid_: Worktree name

### Runtime

**Activity tracker**:
Per-agent transient display state (active tools, streaming response text) bridging spawn callbacks and the TUI widget renderer. Accumulated stats live on the AgentRecord, not here.
_Avoid_: Agent monitor, agent stats

**Nudge**:
A completion notification delivered to the parent session when a background agent settles (first settlement only), or when any agent settles after a continuation. A foreground agent's initial result returns inline through the tool call and delivers no nudge. Batched with a 200ms hold to coalesce rapid completions.
_Avoid_: Callback, notification

**Parent interrupt binding**:
The binding of a foreground Subagent to its parent run's interrupt signal, established at spawn. When the signal aborts (Esc during streaming or tool execution, a stop command, or session shutdown), a running Subagent stops as Stopped (stoppedBy "user", partial output preserved) and a queued Subagent is cancelled before starting. The binding is detached when the Subagent settles, stops, or is removed, so a later interrupt never touches settled work. Background Subagents are never bound.
_Avoid_: Parent abort signal, interrupt listener, parent signal binding

**Settled**:
An agent that is no longer in progress, in one of the terminal statuses: completed, turn_limited, aborted, stopped, error. The AgentStatus tool always lists in-progress (running, queued) agents and shows settled agents most-recently-settled first, capped at the configured `agentStatusLimit` (0 = auto: 2 × default concurrency).
_Avoid_: Done agent, finished agent, terminal agent

**Watchdog**:
Time-based stuck-agent detection that stops a running agent when a single tool call exceeds the tool timeout, or when the agent produces no activity (tool events or streamed response text) for longer than the idle timeout. Both thresholds are configurable in minutes; a watchdog stop is recorded with a reason distinct from a user stop.
_Avoid_: Timeout killer, stuck-agent detector

## Relationships

- An **Agent type** has an optional **Model override**
- A **Project config** overrides the **Global config** per key, for model and concurrency settings only
- A **Subagent** is spawned from one **Agent type**
- A **Subagent** may run in a **Worktree** of the parent's repo or in a directory inside any other git repo on disk
- An **Agent briefing** describes all available **Agent types** to the LLM
- A **Stealth tool** requires an **Agent briefing** before the LLM can use it
- An **Activity tracker** is created per spawn and cleaned up on completion
- A **Nudge** is emitted when a background agent completes, errors, or is stopped (first settlement), and on every settlement of a continued agent
- **Grace turns** are added to the max turns limit to determine when a steered agent is hard-aborted
- A **Watchdog** stops a **Subagent** when a tool call or inactivity exceeds its configured thresholds
- A **Parent interrupt binding** stops a foreground **Subagent** when the parent run is interrupted; background **Subagents** are never bound
- A **Subagent** that is not in progress is **Settled** (completed, turn_limited, aborted, stopped, or error)
- A **Watchdog** stop records a reason distinct from a user stop
- A **Worktree path** is the absolute resolved path passed via `worktree_path`
- A **Worktree label** is derived from a **Worktree path** for compact display
- The `worktree_path` tool param is taught to the LLM via the **Agent briefing**
- An **Agent type** has one **Resolved model**; its **Thinking level** is clamped to that model's supported levels
- The Model settings menu lists only Agent types with an explicit per-type **Model override** at the session, project, or global layer; frontmatter-only and inheriting types are never listed

### Navigation

**Navigation mode**:
Keyboard-driven browsing of agents in the widget (`↑↓` move, `Enter` view, `Esc` back).
State lives on AgentWidget. Key handler in events.ts delegates via public API.
_Avoid_: Nav menu, agent selector

**Roster**:
Ordered list of navigable entries during navigation mode: `main` (virtual) + agents
in widget render order (finished → running → queued, newest-first within each).
_Avoid_: Agent list, nav list

**Freeze window**:
The 2-second period after the last `↑`/`↓` nav move during which the roster keeps its order — a completing agent flips to its live ✓ state in place instead of re-sorting. Membership and row content are never frozen; only ordering is.
_Avoid_: Debounce period, nav lock

**Re-rank**:
Rebuilding the roster into live display order (finished → running → queued) once the freeze window elapses; repeats on every render tick while the user stays idle. The highlight follows its agent by id across a re-rank.
_Avoid_: Re-sort, refresh

**ConversationViewer overlay**:
Live, scrollable view of an agent's conversation, streamed from session events. Opened from the running-agents menu; owns input while open (`Enter` steers, `s` stops).
_Avoid_: ResultViewer, snapshot viewer
